# This is for putting ccache files on tmpfs in a boot persistent way using 
# systemd services. The service should be started before compiling and 
# should be stopped before shutting down the computer.
#
# After copying files, edit:
# /etc/tmpfs-ccache
#
# Start the service with:
# # systemctl start tmpfs-ccache.service
#
# Stop the service with:
# # systemctl stop tmpfs-ccache.service
#
# As regular user, before starting compilation:
# $ /usr/local/bin/tmpfs-ccache-user.sh
#
# Note that this may not be good idea due memory consumption, but for
# automatic start / stop the service on boot:
# # systemctl enable tmpfs-ccache.service
